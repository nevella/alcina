# Introduction #

The `DataTree` class extends GWT Tree, and provides tree views (with actions etc) of nodes - generally with the node tree representing some view of the persistent data model.

# Details #

Simple (parent-child) relations are handled by the `@VisualiserInfo` annotation - e.g. :
```
@VisualiserInfo(displayInfo = @DisplayInfo(name = "Workers", orderingHint = 10, displayMask = DisplayInfo.DISPLAY_AS_TREE_NODE))
```

In this case, the child nodes/containers are generated by the default Node factory, aptly named `NodeFactory`, which generates instances of classes like `DomainNode` and `ContainerNode` (the base class being `FilterableTreeItem`).

More complex cases should use a customised node factory (which handles all creation for a tree) or node creator (which handles creation for a given persistent class) - a good place to look at is `NodeFactory.getNodeForDomainObject()`, as well as the code below. Basically, there are enough hooks in the system to meet any customisation need - I think.

```
class DataTreeWithFactory extends DataTree implements
		NodeFactoryProvider {
	private SSNodeFactory factory = new SSNodeFactory();

	public NodeFactory getNodeFactory() {
		return factory;
	}
}
```
