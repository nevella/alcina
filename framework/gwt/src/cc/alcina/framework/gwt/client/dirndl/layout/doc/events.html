	<h2>Dirndl events</h2>
	<p>The dirndl event system aims to decouple 'event meaning' from 'event handling' - which is
		both essential for preserving the declarative nature of the ui generation, and a significant aid
		to clarity and code reuse.
	<p>The basic philosophy is 'convert DOM events to Model (semantic) events low, and handle
		semantic events high', low and high being levels in the dirndl node tree.

 <p>
 How the example below works:
 
 <p>
 {@code Link}...withModelEvent(ModelEvents.Add.class) instructs the Link
 instance to translate a dom ClickEvent on its rendered DOM element to a
 ModelEvent.Add event, which is then propagated up the stack. From the
 application logic point of view, this is defining what a click on that Link
 <i>means</i> (add) without needing to define there how to handle that 'add'.
 
 <p>
 At any point higher in the model structure (in this case, we're using the
 containing {@link Croissanteria} instance, the 'add' event can be handled by
 registering it as a receiver (adding the event class to
 the @Directed.receives array) and implementing the event's Handler interface. Note that the first requirement is going away, implementing the handler interface will soon be the sole routing requirement
 
 <p>
 By default, the onXxx event handlers consume Model events (not DOM events) -
 to continue bubbling, call event.bubble()
 		
	<pre><code>

@Directed(
    receives = { ModelEvents.Add.class, CroissanteriaEvents.TrySample.class })
class Croissanteria extends Model.Fields implements
        CroissanteriaEvents.TrySample.Handler, ModelEvents.Add.Handler {
    @Directed
    String orderDemo = "Your order is 1 chocolate croissant and an espresso";

    Link addAnotherCroissant = new Link().withText("Add another croissant")
            .withModelEvent(ModelEvents.Add.class);

    Link tryASample = new Link().withText("Try a free sample")
            .withModelEvent(CroissanteriaEvents.TrySample.class);

    @Override
    public void onAdd(Add event) {
        Window.alert("adding another croissant...");
    }

    @Override
    public void onTrySample(TrySample event) {
        Window.alert("trying a free sample...");
    }
}
    
	</code></pre>
