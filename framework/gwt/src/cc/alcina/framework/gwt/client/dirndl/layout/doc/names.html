	<h2>Dirndl names</h2>
	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Minimise rendered html size
		<li>Mininmise generated css size
		<li>Make html legible (tags reflect model classes)
	</ul>
	<h3>Guidelines</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>If the rendered model class has no subclasses, don't use a tag or cssClass attribute
			(rendered tag name will be the css-ified simple class name)
		<li>If the rendered model class has subclasses, but no UI attributes (css styles) which
			should be shared by subclasses, ditto
		<li>Otherwise: if it's known that <b>sub</b>-classes have no subclass-specific styles -and-
			subclass tag names wouldn't appreciably improve html legibility , set the tag attribute of the
			parent class @Directed annotation
		<li>Otherwise set the cssClass attribute of the parent class @Directed annotation - almost
			always <b>don't</b> use scss mixins to replicates styles to the different subclass tags (unless,
			say, the hierarchy is final/sealed - but even then the resultant css is probably )
	</ul>
	<h3>Example - the Dirndl Tree</h3>
	<p>
		Both the container -
		<code>Tree</code>
		- and the node class -
		<code>TreeNode</code>
		are intended for subclassing. Both base classes have styles. Since the container occurs only once,
		definitely uss cssClass (not tag) since it will only bulk the html a few bytes and will improve
		legibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each tree can contain potentially many treenode instances, so using cssClass -
		<code>&lt;my-node class="node"&gt;</code>
		- is a little more wordy tha <code>&lt;node"&gt;</code> - but it's necessary for custom styling of subclass nodes - <code>.my-node label {color: blue};</code>
	</p>
