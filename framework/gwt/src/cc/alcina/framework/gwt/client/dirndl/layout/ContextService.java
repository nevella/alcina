 * A while later...actually, this looks like being the third limb of inter-model
 * communication, as well as simplifying ContextResolver itself no end
 * <p>
 * Models can register services (if they have a defined ContextResolver - say by
 * annotating with DelegatingContextResolver) that descendant models can consume
 * - basically to provide cross-layer 'props' - aka immutable state
