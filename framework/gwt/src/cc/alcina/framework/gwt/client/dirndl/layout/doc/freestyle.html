	<h3>Model, direction and events</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>DirectedLayout.Node *did* have an ancestorModel(Predicate) method which would allow child
			nodes access to the parent model. That method was deprecated and removed - usages were replaced
			with ModelEvent emission (where ancestor model access was used to send signals to the ancestor
			model ) and by adding access to specific models via ContextResolver. See for example
			<code>cc.alcina.framework.gwt.client.dirndl.model.FormModel.CancelHandler</code>
