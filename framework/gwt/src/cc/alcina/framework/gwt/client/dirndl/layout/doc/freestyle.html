	<h2>Dirndl freestyle</h2>
	<p>
		<i>notes to be allocated to the document structure</i>
	</p>
	<h3>Model, direction and events</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>DirectedLayout.Node *did* have an ancestorModel(Predicate) method which would allow child
			nodes access to the parent model. That method was deprecated and removed - usages were replaced
			with ModelEvent emission (where ancestor model access was used to send signals to the ancestor
			model ) and by adding access to specific models via ContextResolver. See for example <code>cc.alcina.framework.gwt.client.dirndl.model.FormModel.CancelHandler</code>
	</ul>
	<h3>AnnotationLocation and transform (WIP)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p>dirndl 1x1d - the interplay between AnnotationLocation and transform is being changed
		<p>Property P - Model A - property value A.P of type List&lt;E1&gt; - Transform T [E1 -&gt; E2]
			<ul>
				<li>A.P :: List&lt;E1&gt; - AnnLocation A.P[E1]
				<li>E2 (no property)
			</ul>
