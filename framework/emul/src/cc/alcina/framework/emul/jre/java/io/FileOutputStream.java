/**
 * A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
 * <code>File</code> or to a <code>FileDescriptor</code>. Whether or not
 * a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying
 * platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened
 * for writing by only one <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> (or other
 * file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in
 * this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
 *
 * <p><code>FileOutputStream</code> is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
 * such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using
 * <code>FileWriter</code>.
