# Welcome to Alcina

Named for an opera by the baroque composer Georg Friederich HÃ¤ndel, Alcina is a set of
components that collectively implement a generative-process, semi-declarative client/server programming idiom
which transforms common application tasks into stream processes.

_Generative-process_ - several complex-ish application problems are tackled by Alcina with "generative" algorithms - algorithms
that generate later steps in the process during algorithm processing, rather than with up-front (imperative) specification, and as
explicit steps rather than using recursion.
The problems are: UI modelling (Dirndl), deep website modelling (Selection Traversal), document transformation (Selection Traversal) and dependency resolution (Consort).

_Semi-declarative_ code tries to reconcile the virtues of declarative and imperative programming -
the basic philosophy being "declarative for composition" - say, composing a UI from an annotated object tree
rather than widget.add methods - "imperative for logic" - falling back on imperative code to resolve more
complex logical decisions. This encourages granular programming in certain key areas
of the client/server software stack, and helps to minimise code replication, reuse domain
logic and maximise (within limits) performance.

The main components of Alcina are (in no particular order):

## Enhanced GWT

Features which allow GWT - https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt - to be a reasonable development environment
for modern browsers:

- **Websocket/pure-js dev mode** - code and debug in java with <1s refresh times
- **Local DOM** - a GWT virtual dom, minimising jvm/browser rpc and enabling close-to-pure server-side applications
  (i.e. where client app state is maintained and html generated server side, client code mainly routes DOM events)
- **Reflection** - implementation of class/property reflection in the GWT client, and tooling to minimise the
  client footprint

## Transforms

Conversion of all mutations of relational persistent objects (entities) in a graph ("domain") to a
sequence of operations ("transforms"). This has the following benefits:

- Low-code **relational** offline support. Although many systems (Firebase et al.) offer simple key/value offline
  browser support, relational offline support is significantly more complex and still has few implementations
  (Apple CoreData is another)
- Undo support
- Reduces difficulties involved in EJB manipulations of highly connected graphs
- Provides a natural way to program cancellable edits (via AdjunctTransformManager (client) (v2 in progress))
- Centralisation of permissions domain logic
- Provides an audit log
- Provides a centralised application-side stream for processor domain logic ('cascades' or 'triggers'), both client and server
- Reduces the differentiation between client and server code, since they use the same persistence mechanism (although
  transactions are explicit server-side, implicit client-side)

## Dirndl

**Dir**ectedA**ndD**irected**L**ayout - a complete UI framework, runnable client- or server-side, that uses the
expressive power of three tree structures (the view container hierarchy - _more or less_ the DOM; the Java class hierarchy;
the class/property hierarchy) to generate a UI from an arbitrary model with minimal imperative code.

Best shown by examples:
(TBD - show a collection rendering, show event handling, show an app skeleton)

## Domain Store

An in-memory, transactional, clustered, memory- and performance- optimised entity cache, where entities do not require
hydration/dehydration, but can be accessed using standard java semantics - e.g. `Group group = User.byId(1).getPrimaryGroup();`

---

Smaller components or points of departure, again in no particular order:

## Registry

## Publications

## Permissions

[Declarative permissions](doc/components/permissions.md), client and server.

## Authentication

## Jobs

## Cluster

## Knowns

## Webdriver

## Consort

## DomainView

## SelectionTraversal

## Context + Process + Frame

Since Alcina is all about process, and every process loves a good [context](doc/components/context-and-process-and-frame.md)

## Build

For progress on the transition to mvn, see [readme-build.md](readme-build.md)
