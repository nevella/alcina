# Welcome to Alcina

Named for an opera by the baroque composer Georg Friederich HÃ¤ndel, Alcina is an integrated set of 
software components that collectively implement a particular client/server programming idiom.

The idiom is named "semi-declarative", and it encourages granular programming in certain key areas
of the client/server software stack, with the end goal being to minimise replication, reuse domain 
logic and maximise (within limits) performance.

The main components of Alcina are (in no particular order):

## Enhanced GWT
Features which allow GWT - https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt - to be a reasonable development environment
for modern browsers:
*	**Websocket/pure-js dev mode** - code and debug in java with <1s refresh times
*	**Local DOM** - a GWT virtual dom, minimising jvm/browser rpc and enabling pure- or close-to-pure server page generation
*	**Reflection** - implementation of class/property reflection in the GWT client, and tooling to minimise the 
	client footprint

##	Transforms
Conversion of all mutations of relational persistent objects (entities) in a graph ("domain") to a 
sequence of operations ("transforms"). This has the following benefits:
*	Low-code **relational** offline support. Although many systems (Firebase et al.) offer simple key/value offline
	browser support, relational offline support is significantly more complex and still has few implementations
	 (Apple CoreData is another).
*	Undo support	 
*	Reduces difficulties involved in EJB manipulations of highly connected graphs.
*	Provides a natural way to program cancellable edits (via AdjunctTransformManager (client) (v2 in progress)).
*	Centralisation of permissions domain logic
*	Provides an audit log
*	Provides a centralised application-side stream for processor domain logic ('cascades' or 'triggers'), both client and server.

##	Dirndl
"**Dir**ectedA**ndD**irected**L**ayout - a complete UI framework, runnable client- or server-side, that uses the 
expressive power of two tree structures (the view containment hierarchy - *more or less* the DOM - and the Java class hierarchy) 
to generate a UI from an arbitrary model with minimal imperative code.

Best shown by examples:
(TBD - show a collection rendering, show event handling, show an app skeleton)
